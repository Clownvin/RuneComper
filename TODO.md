# TODOs

## Bugs

- Some quests are being added as achievements when finding all achievements

## Tasks

- Add MQC requirements: <https://runescape.wiki/w/Master_quest_cape#Requirements>
- Add "True trim" requirements
- Handle "OR" requirements properly during requirement building (ex. As a First Resort and the Warriors Guild requirements)
- Add ability to determine unknown requirement types via wiki lookup

## Ideas

- Add items/areas/reputation/etc as requirements

## Optimization

- Dependency count function is slow/inefficient
